    "text": "In this paper we propose a new approach for developing a proof that P=NP. Wepropose to use a polynomial-time reduction of a NP-complete problem to LinearProgramming. Earlier such attempts used polynomial-time transformation which isa special form of reduction that uses a subroutine for the easier LinearProgramming Problem only once. We use multiple calls to the subroutineincreasing considerably the effectiveness of the reduction. Further theNP-complete problem we choose is also unusual. We define a special kind ofacyclic directed graph which we call a time graph. We define Hamiltonian timepaths in such graphs and also the Hamiltonian Time Path problem (HTPATH) andprove that it is NP-complete. We then state a conjecture whose proof willimmediately lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem proving P=NP."
