  overview: In this paper we propose a new approach for developing a proof that P=NP.
    Wepropose to use a polynomial-time reduction of a NP-complete problem to LinearProgramming.
    Earlier such attempts used polynomial-time transformation which isa special form
    of reduction that uses a subroutine for the easier LinearProgramming Problem only
    once. We use multiple calls to the subroutineincreasing considerably the effectiveness
    of the reduction. Further theNP-complete problem we choose is also unusual. We
    define a special kind ofacyclic directed graph which we call a time graph. We
    define Hamiltonian timepaths in such graphs and also the Hamiltonian Time Path
    problem (HTPATH) andprove that it is NP-complete. We then state a conjecture whose
    proof willimmediately lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem proving
    P=NP.
